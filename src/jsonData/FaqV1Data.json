When they launched their businesses, their massive personal brands acted as built-in marketing engines—causing their companies to explode.\n\nToday, social media gives the average person the same opportunity. You don’t have to be an actor, singer, or athlete to build a brand and a business. If you're a business owner, you can grow both yourself and your company through content like never before.\n\nThere’s a massive opportunity here—and if you don’t take it, your competitors will… and they'll take your customers with them.",

The only thing you need to do is show up, because it’s your personal brand. Most clients spend about 4–6 hours a month filming, but that can vary depending on how fast you are on camera and how many takes you prefer. While we don’t guarantee an exact time commitment, our goal is to make filming the easiest part of your month.",
